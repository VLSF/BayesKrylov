The current repository accompanies the article "Uncertainty calibration for probabilistic projection methods". The whole project is based on ideas from two articles [A Bayesian Conjugate Gradient Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.05242) and [Probabilistic Linear Solvers: A Unifying View](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03398). In the article, we propose a new prior that fixes problems with the posterior covariance matrix. Two scripts here can be used to reproduce experimental results (Section 7) presented in our article.
